[2048+](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2048+/id855231036?mt=12) is based on [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), created by Gabriele Cirulli, which was based on 1024 by Veewo Studio and conceptually similar to Threes by Asher Vollmer. 

How to play: 

1. Swipe to move the tiles. 
2. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one.

2048+ created with following enhancements: 

* You can swipe the tiles with Magic Trackpad 
* Magic Mouse is also supported 
* Sound effect 
* Immersive Full-Screen mode 
* Playing a game offline 

Join the numbers and get to the 2048 tile!
